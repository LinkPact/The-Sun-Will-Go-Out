[BO_Border_Station]
Rumor1 = Shooting with all you got all the time is not always necessarily better. Often it is better to be more conservative. Watch your energy when having a secondary weapon equipped. You can toggle it off and on using the 'Space'-key. 
Rumor2 = It is a hard life, here in Sector X. All the piracy doesn't make it better. Watch out for hostile ships, or they will try to bring you down! You can see them as red dots on your radar.
Rumor5 = Low on rupees? One way to get an income is helping out the people of the sector. Most of the time they will try to reward you in what ways they can when helping them out.
Rumor6 = Low on rupees? Plunder the plunderer! Shoot down those damn pirates that are sucking the life out of this sector!
Rumor7 = Have you forgot what you were told to do during a mission? Go to the mission menu. You can often find useful hints there.

[SX_Highfence]
Rumor1 = The shops often get new parts. If you return later to an already visited shop you might find new parts which not were there before.
Rumor2 = My son has gone on a journey to the distant Peye. He heard rumors of a challenge without comparision in this sector. Madness. I hope he will come back alive.
Rumor3 = I am hungry. The Alliance say that they will "eliminate the hunger". But does anyone actually believe them?
Rumor4 = Don't think that the Alliance are in charge here. The whole colony is run by smugglers and criminals.
Rumor5 = Pirate attacks of transporter ships have become more and more common. Soon you will need an escort even to be able to visit your closest neighbours.
Rumor7 = This sector is swarmed by those pirate scum. They shouldn't be a problem for you though, as their engines are quite old. Just keep a close eye to your radar, and you should be able to outrun them.

[SX_Fortrun]
Rumor1 = I have heard that the alliance are aliens sent here from another solar system, and that they are planning to infiltrate and kill us all... KILL US ALL...
Rumor2 = If it weren't for those pesky rebels... Since they started whining about everything, everything has started spiralling downwards. Why can't they see that the the Alliance are doing their best to help us?
Rumor3 = Rumour says, somewhere outside the system lives a giant duck! His name is.. spaceduck!
Rumor4 = Someone told me that if I save my energy my shields charge faster. Could that really be true?

[SX_New_Norrland]
Rumor1 = I have heard that the alliance are aliens sent here from another solar system, and that they are planning to infiltrate and kill us all... KILL US ALL...
Rumor2 = I have heard there are planets which can't be seen on the regular radar. Maybe if you look closer..
Rumor3 = Those rebel scums plundered my farm and stole all of my cattle. Rain fire on them all!
Rumor4 = The people living at Soelara are quite odd. It is said they eat raw potatoes!

[SX_Station1_Lavis]
Rumor1 = I heard a ship from Soelara Station and it's crew has gone missing. 
Rumor2 = My son joined the Alliance months ago. Now he is fighting pirates and rebels for our good. I am so proud!
Rumor3 = Those big transport ships are the lifeblood in this solar system. They transport wares and peoples between different planets. Bring them down, and you bring the whole sector down.
Rumor4 = They are after our titanium. That's why the alliance are here. You must to stop them! 
Rumor5 = I have to say, I adore you youngsters with your high morals. Thinking that you actually can do a difference here in Sector X. Best wishes to you and your silly thoughts. I hope you will stay alive.

[SX_Station1_Soelara]
Rumor1 = I heard that the people on the New Norrland recently were attacked by pirates.
Rumor2 = Someone said the Alliance are about to tighten the grip on this station. I have heard that they might even throw out the Crimson Cross. Why would they do such a thing!
Rumor3 = Yesterday my brothers transport ship was attacked by pirates while traveling to highfence. I hope he is okay...
Rumor4 = The people living at New Norrland are quite odd. I have heard that they still are trying to use wind power!

[SX_Fortrun_1]
Rumor1 = I have heard there are planets which can't be seen on the regular radar. Maybe if you look closer..
Rumor2 = Some people are talking about some mad scientist who lives on Peye... 
Rumor3 = Life has gotten harder as our energy sources are declining. We simply must find new ways to produce energy. I believe that new technology is our only hope.
Rumor4 = I have heard that it is possible to enhance your motors, enabling you to travel at incredible speed. I have also heard that the alliance forbade it as it consumed too much energy. It is said that they nevertheless are using it themselves. Stupid hypocrits.

[SX_Fortrun_2]
Rumor1 = Fusion power is still the leading energy source around here. The alliance are fervently searching for more advanced power sources. Some say that is why they have spread out their prying eyes all over this solar system.
Rumor2 = Have you done any good yet? I hope you are here to actually help us out. Many are only here for the money. Oh-so-sad for them when they realise that Sector X is a quite bad place to treasure hunt. The Alliance and the Rebels came here first.
Rumor3 = We were plundered last week and now my family is starving. Was it the rebels? Was it the pirates? No-one can distinguish them anymore. I hope the alliance comes back here soon.

[SX_Peye]
Rumor1 = It must have taken some time, to write all those rumours! Someone really likes to write text-strings!
Rumor2 = Have you heard the story of old Earth. The place we used to live. Heard they blew it all to pieces and now we are all stuck here.
Rumor3 = We've got to hold together in this sector. It might be hard times now, but my gut tells me this is only the beginning. After rain comes thunder.
Rumor4 = Have you found a favourite weapon, able to bring down the toughest of enemies? You should tell the developers, so that they can nerf it until the next version!
Rumor5 = Have you beaten the mad scientists level yet? I have heard it is the hardest challenge currently seen in Sector X. Good luck with that!

[OX_OutpostX_Station]
Rumor1 = How did you find our super-secret base!? We are developing experimental weapons here, forbidden by the Alliance and hidden for the rebels. If you don't mind, take a look in our shop. Don't tell the Alliance or the Rebels though, or we will come after you...

Rumor2 = I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Jakob likes Ellen!
Rumor3 = I heard that the people on the Iceplanet recently were attacked by pirates.
