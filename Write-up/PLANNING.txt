PLANNING THE STORY WORKING

Where is the story work now?
- Soon, an overview over locations, characters, missions, and
	content is finished.
- Some actual textual content that could be used for mission text
	is in place.

So, two main parts, which both consists of several subparts. The overviews section, and the go-through.

>>> Overviews

Brief
Clear overview graph displaying the mission-flow. No so much details about characters and such here. Can probably be inspired by the current manuscript overview.

Characters
Describe the characters and their background in a little more detail.

Levels
Link to the different mission titles. Which levels occur on each mission?

>>> More extensive go-through

Can be based on the current go-through. Refine it to look good, and be readable by other persons. In the end, post it on the forum?

Finish this during the weekend? Probably possible if I add a few hours!
