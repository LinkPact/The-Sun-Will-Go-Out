\subsection{At Border Station}

"You must be the new pilot, right?" A middle aged man eyes you carefully.
"I am Bert, and I am coordinating the pilots here at Border Station.
Previously, my job was mainly to keep track of our transport ships, but lately
rebels has become an increasing nuisance. Here and in the rest of the sector."
"We believe that there is a small rebel fleet hiding in a nearby meteor belt.
They are not a threat against the Border Station itself, but they raid and plunder ships
and transport travelling in the area."
"We must stop them now, before they do any more damage. A small fleet will leave in any
moment to search the meteor belt and try to root them out. You should join them.
You might learn a thing or two."

\subsection{Outside Border Station}

[Captain of the fleet] "Another rookie? Fantastic! Stay close to us veterans, and
you might even be helpful! We are leaving now, over and out."

\subsection{Travelling to Meteor Belt}

[Sair] "So this seems to be going quite well. I hope you are focused.
I would really dislike getting holes blasted in the hull."

[Captain] "So rookie, I see you have one of those silly talking ships? 
Bahaha! Don't let it distract you."

[Sair] "..."

\subsection{At Meteor Belt}

[Captain] "Let's see.. According to our scans this rebel group should have much lower firepower than
us. They should just be cannon fodder for our lasers. We must still be careful. There could be many of them.
We want to shoot down as many as possible of them, but it is better to let a ship go than letting it giving
you a hit. The goal is to scare them of, not eradicate them."

... Level begins ...

[Captain] "Stay clear of those meteors. There is no point in shooting them down."

[Captain] "Here they come! Stay close, shoot down as many as you can. Remeber,
you fire through pressing and holding the ACTIONKEY1. Give them hell rookie, give them hell."

...Level ends...

[Captain] "That's a job well done. That should keep them away for a while. Well done rookie! 
Your XXX downed ships really made a difference.
I will make sure you are rewarded accordingly. Now, let's head back to Border Station."

\subsection{Travelling back from Meteor Belt}

[Sair] "...That is one annoying captain. We managed this well though. A good start in the Alliance."

\subsection{At Border Station}

You are greeted by Bert. "Well done, well done! Keep it up, and you will have loads of opportunities
in the Alliance. The sector is troubled right now. Resources are running out one after another,
and at the same time the rebels attacks get more and more frequent. We can really use a pilot like you."

"Here is your reward! XX rupees, plus a bonus XX for the ships you brought down. This weapon could also be of use
for you. It is called a 'Spead Bullet', and is a powerful close-range weapon."

"You are able to equip up to two primary weapons at a time. This means you could use both the Basic Laser and 
the Spread bullet in a single level. You can toggle between your equipped weapons during a level using the ACTIONKEY2."

"As a next step you should go to Highfence and talk to a woman called Ai. I will send her my recommendations.
She will certainly have some job for you. The sector is troubled right now. Stay safe."
