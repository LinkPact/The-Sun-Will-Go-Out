\subsection{Asteroid belt}

[Sair] "It is possible that we could manage to destroy the entire Murt meteorite before anyone else
reaches the location."

[Sair] "It would mean that we keep Murt out of the hands of both the Alliance and the rebels."

[Sair] "It would also mean that we destroy what rightfully belongs to the people of this sector."

[Sair] "Something that could transform their life to the better."

[Sair] "It would kill the entire Alliance- and rebels-fleet that are here, and likely burn away this side of New Norrland."

[Sair] "It would be the end for us."

[Sair] "We wouldn't be thanked for that. It wouldn't end the conflict." 

[Sair] "But at the same time it would prevent the Murt from being misused to kill and control."

[Sair] "Do you think this is the best of the worst choices?"

> "Yes. Let's go ahead and destroy the Murt."
> "I have to think a bit more about this."

[Sair] "Well then, it is decided. Let's go!"

\subsection{Travelling to Murt}

[Alliance] "Identify yourself! Are you a rebel ship? I'm sorry. We can't let you continue."

... Avoidance The Alliance level ...

[Sair] "Well done. The area seems to be swarmed by both Alliance and rebel scouts keep your guard up."

[Sair] "A rebel scout fleet is incoming. Let's try to slip through!"

... Avoid The Rebels level ...

\subsection{Murt}

[Sair] "Finally, we made it through! It appears we managed to make it here before the others."

[Sair] "To end this, just open fire. Heat the asteroid until it takes fire. Burning it. Burning it all."

[Sair] "Are you ready to do it? Is this the way to go? I still don't know."

[Sair] "Maybe we are removing the systems last hope in vain."

[Sair] "Or maybe this will prevent further war and chaos."

[Sair] "No backing down now, I guess. Let's open fire!"

... Last level, setting a meteor on fire ...

... Fading out, displaying the explosion, before the after text comes in
