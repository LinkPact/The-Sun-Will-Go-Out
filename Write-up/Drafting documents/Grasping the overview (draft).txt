Phase 1
-------------------------------------

Overview

- The player gets acquainted to the game mechanics
- The player gets an initial mission (for who? purpose?)
- The player is sent to Highfence for another mission (why is the player sent there?)
- This other mission is performed for the Alliance. 
	It should hopefully be some kind of presentation of the organization.
- After that mission the player is let free a little bit, to roam around
	and make a few (maybe not so many) side-quests.
- After some point (time or missions), something is triggered, and
	the player gets information to initiate phase 2.

Thoughts
- The phase should be presented in a way which not makes it to the least interesting story-part
	of the game.
- It should be related to the rebels and the alliance. The game isn't big enough to be
	spent doodling around with un-important fractions. So, worth to think about
	the beginning another lap.

> Initial mission on Border Station
> Highfence - Soelara transport protection mission

Phase 2
-------------------------------------

Overview

- It is now time for the player to do a few missions for the Alliance (2-4? We could probably cut down
	from our current visions).
- It is probably good if the player not get too invested in the Alliance, as he/she soon will be
	ripped away, and put into the rebel fraction.
- I guess that the ripping-away-part still require us to come up with one of the more interesting
	explanations in the game for that transition.
- Nevertheless, the player gets due to some reason missions from the Alliance.
- First, a nice mission. Help those nice people out.
- Second, a less nice mission. Who ARE those people?`
- Third, the rebel mission. Here, your allegience to the Alliance is ended due to some reason.
- It would probably be interesting to interact with both a very representative Alliance character,
	as well as with another character which can put some seeds of doubt into the players head.

> Defend colony mission, the player travels with the Alliance to New Norrland to protect the Alliance's interests
> ... Maybe one interlude mission?
> Kill The Rebels, Kill Them All. The player travels with the Alliance to the Rebel base to squash the resistance.
> The squashing backfires, and the player leaves the Alliance. 
	Why? Maybe another person strongly recommended it? Where you a rebel infiltrator?? 
	Did your contact want you to prevent the attack?
	Maybe even you played a role in the prevention?	

Phase 3
-------------------------------------

Overview

- We have now landed at the rebels place. I'd guess that we need two characters to interact to here too.
- We have got a dramatic introduction (which still needs to be thought through!)
- First, we will help out the rebels through attacking a transporter ship of interest. This transporter
	contains interesting materials of interest for the Alliance.


- Soon there after you are sent to retrieve a scientist from Peye. You return him to the rebels.
- You are then sent away from the rebels by an external. 

> You are helping the rebels now. Probably with an initial fuzzy feeling about it.
> Start out by raiding an Alliance ship to collect its cargo.
> ... Something happens here? Inducing dislike for the rebels?
> Soon you are travelling to retrieve a scientist living at Peye, in order to extract information about Murt.
> After the scientist is retrieved it is time jump over board, leaving the ship. Travelling for some other plans.

Phase 4
-------------------------------------

Overview

- Now interesting things are happening. You are travelling to Highfence due to some reason for further instructions.
- Here you meet up with some interesting people. Together you are travelling to Soelara or New Norrland where you
	have some kind of meeting for further plans.
- You are sent to Fortrun to get something, either information, materials or something else.
- Here you realize that the Grand And Moral Plan has failed.
- What to do now? What to do now? Time to force the player to do a nice decision based on all the information
	gathered up to this point.

> You are travelling to Highfence while being followed. After 1-2 levels you rendevouz with someone there who gives you more info.
> Next, travel either to a meeting place, or maybe even directly to Fortrun. Now the plan is clear. You also have some friendly company.
> On your way to Fortrun you are confronted and will be asked a few questions. This will probably end in a quite tough level.
> On Fortrun you realize your plans have kallopsat, and it is now up to you with friends to decide which path to go.

> From here you can go with the Alliance, or the Rebels, or taking it all in your own hands.


PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENT STORY

-> The first part of the game does not have much purpose, not a strong story here, more doodling around
-> Also in the Alliance part you are partly doodling around. It might pique the interest of the player if we could
	put what he is doing there in a bigger picture?
-> The total story arc we have is interesting, but might be too big. We need the player
	to change allegiance first to the Alliance, then to the Rebels, and lastly, break free and think for himself.
	That might feel a bit forced?
-> The center of the game (Murt) is currently introduced close to the end of the game, which reduces the impact on
	the story it could have. It might feel like you are doodling around for a while, and then BAM, you
	are playing out an epic ending. It would have been perfect if we gradually could build up the tension
	through all the phases, for a climax in the fourth phase.
-> We need a lot of characters to be able to depict a nuanced picture of our complex organizations. Nuanced depictions
	takes significant amount of words and space in the story. Therefore, it would be better for us to have fewer,
	deeper character. How should we solve this?
