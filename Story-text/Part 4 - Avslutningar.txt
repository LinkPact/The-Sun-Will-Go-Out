Your former commander stares at you. "So the traitor has returned. I guess you have changed your mind,
the Alliance is not as promising as before?"
His mimic melted slightly. "We know that you might have crucial information about the whereabouts of
this meteor everyone is so fired up about. Help us out here, and I will make sure that we'll make
your hickup slide."
"It is imperial that we get to the meteor before the Alliance. If they are the ones to get control over it
they will be able to totally dominate this sector militarily. It will be their rule, with their rules.
The people will have no way to fight back, and the less interesting parts of the galaxy will succumb to poverty
and starvation."
"I hope you'll help us. I know that you don't like all of our methods. We feel the same. But sometimes
there are things you must do. You must never forget your goal. And if you not are willing to make sacrifices,
those who are will beat you there."

"Are you willing to help us out?"

"Yes. I'll show you to the meteor"
- His face lit up. "Fantastic. I know you were made of the right material. Let's leave right away.
The Alliance is not idle. They will attack with everything they've got. Let's roll out!"

"It is a big decision. I'll need some more time to think.."
- His smile dropped. "I don't know what you are thinking. I am afraid you aren't thinking straight"
His eyed almost looked begging, desperate. "Please change your mind. We will forget your past.
If you help us here, you are helping everyone"

Your former collegue stares sceptically at you. "So you are back.. I guess the rebels wasn't as
nice and cosy as you thought.."
"You have the opportunity to really help us out here. We are in quite the pinch. Both we and the
rebels are searching for the meteor, but they seem to have the upper hand in the search due to that
poor scientist they kidnapped. What kind of people does things like that?"
"You could help us out. It looks like they will beat us to the meteor, but if you help us we might get
to them before they can start utilizing the energy. When they does, show mercy on this sector."
"They will kill every single one of us Alliance. Then they will kill of those who have helped them.
They will claim it is for the higher purpose of freeing the people. What they don't realise is that
they will be the peoples new slavers, much cruder and harsher than we ever have been."
"I'm the first to admit that we not always have been the nicest. But we are trying to be righteous.
It is so hard in times like those to make everyone happy"

"Will you help us? With your information, we might, just might this catastrophe from developing.
We will strike swiftly, and we will show mercy on those who lay down their weapons. You have my word"

"Yes. I'll show you to the meteor"
- He looked sincerely happy about this. "We won't let you down. Come, lets finally bring peace and prosperity to this sector."

"It is a big decision. I'll need some more time to think.."
- He looked even more stern. "They are fooling you, with their cosy words. The reality is something else.
They are far worse than us. You know they torture innocent people, you know they won't hestitate to kill civilians
in order to gain power. I sincerely hope that you'll change your mind"

On Your Own-arc
- Åk till asteroidbältet

..radio contact initiated.. "What should we do? We could blow it up, or we could help either the Rebels
or the Alliance gaining access to the mineral. It might be used to save this sector, and let us live here
for several more hundred years. Or it might initiate a war which will scar every single planet, and induce suffering unheard of."
He started sounding more and more desperate. "I don't know, I don't know, I DON'T KNOW! We are not the right people to make
those decisions. What do you think we should do?"

"We need to take this in our hands. We need to blow it up."
- You heard them mumble ..this will make us the murderes.. ..there is no other way..
and then finally, with a trembling voice. "Yes. Let's go."

"We need more time to think. Let's see what the Alliance and Rebels has to say"
- You hear a sight of release from the other. "Yes, let's do that."
