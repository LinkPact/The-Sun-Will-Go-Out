[BO_Border_Station]
Rumor1 = Shooting with all you got all the time is not always necessarily better. Often it is better to be more conservative. Watch your energy when having a secondary weapon equipped. You can toggle it off and on using the 'Space'-key. 
Rumor2 = It is a hard life, here in Sector X. All the piracy doesn't make it better. Watch out for hostile ships, or they will try to bring you down! You can see them as red dots on your radar.
Rumor3 = Low on rupees? One way to get an income is helping out the people of the sector. Most of the time they will try to reward you in what ways they can when helping them out.
Rumor4 = Low on rupees? Plunder the plunderer! Shoot down those damn rebels that are sucking the life out of this sector!
Rumor5 = Have you forgot what you were told to do during a mission? Go to the mission menu. You can often find useful hints there.

[MO_Mining_Station]
Rumor1 = We should look for rebels in our mining fields, you say? They are always lurking around here, waiting for the Alliance to let their guard down...
Rumor2 = My favourite mineral to mine is copper. That reddish tint. It looks fabolous!
Rumor3 = Be careful with the rebels. You think you are safe because of that you have a much stronger ship than most of them. But if you let your guard down for a moment then BAM, they are all over you!

[SX_Highfence]
Rumor1 = A lot of people around here are whining about the rebel attacks. Shouldn't they be more concerned about the Alliance, slowly sucking out all resources from the sector?
Rumor2 = My son has gone on a journey to the distant Peye. He heard rumors of a challenge without comparison in this sector. Madness. I hope he will come back alive.
Rumor3 = I am hungry. The Alliance say that they will "eliminate the hunger". But does anyone actually believe them?
Rumor4 = Rebel attacks of transporter ships have become more and more common. Soon you will need an escort even to be able to visit your closest neighbours.
Rumor5 = This sector is swarmed by those rebel scum. They shouldn't be a problem for you though, as their engines are quite old. Just keep a close eye to your radar, and you should be able to outrun them.

[SX_Fortrun]
Rumor1 = I have heard that the Alliance are aliens sent here from another solar system, and that they are planning to infiltrate and kill us all... KILL US ALL...
Rumor2 = If it weren't for those pesky rebels... Since they started whining about everything, everything has started spiralling downwards. Why can't they see that the the Alliance are doing their best to help us?
Rumor3 = Rumour says, somewhere outside the system lives a giant duck! His name is.. spaceduck!
Rumor4 = Someone told me that if I save my energy my shields charge faster. Could that really be true?
Rumor5 = You come from Border Station, you say? You are all a bunch of dirty low-lifes. We are civilized here. Please leave.

[SX_New_Norrland]
Rumor1 = Have you heard about Murt? It is a mineral with very unique properties. Both the Alliance and the rebels seem very keen to get their hands on our Murt-mines..
Rumor2 = I have heard there are planets which can't be seen on the regular radar. Maybe if you look closer..
Rumor3 = Those rebel scums plundered my farm and stole all of my cattle. Rain fire on them all!
Rumor4 = The people living at Soelara are quite odd. It is said they eat raw potatoes!

[SX_Station1_Lavis]
Rumor1 = I heard a ship from Soelara Station and it's crew has gone missing. 
Rumor2 = My son joined the Alliance months ago. Now he is fighting rebels for our good. I am so proud!
Rumor3 = Those big transport ships are the lifeblood in this solar system. They transport wares and peoples between different planets. Bring them down, and you bring the whole sector down.
Rumor4 = They are after our titanium. That's why the alliance are here. You must to stop them! 
Rumor5 = I have to say, I adore you youngsters with your high morals. Thinking that you actually can do a difference here in Sector X. Best wishes to you and your silly ideas. I hope you will stay alive.

[SX_Station1_Soelara]
Rumor1 = The trading route to Highfence is the lifeblood of this planet. The plundering has made the life really tough around here.
Rumor2 = You need to watch out for the Alliance. They say they want to help you, but it is all about increasing the wealth on Fortrun. They don't care about us.
Rumor3 = Yesterday my brothers transport ship was attacked by rebels while traveling to highfence. I hope he is okay...
Rumor4 = The people living at New Norrland are quite odd. I have heard that they still are trying to use wind power!

[SX_Fortrun_1]
Rumor1 = Have you heard about the scientists living on Peye? An odd bunch. Mostly silent, and then BAM, they invent something. Their beacons are really useful. If they only could transport larger ships.
Rumor2 = Life has gotten harder as our energy sources are declining. We simply must find new ways to produce energy. I believe that new technology is our only hope.
Rumor3 = I have heard that it is possible to enhance your motors, enabling you to travel at incredible speed. I have also heard that the alliance forbade it as it consumed too much energy. It is said that they nevertheless are using it themselves. Stupid hypocrits.

[SX_Fortrun_2]
Rumor1 = Fusion power is still the leading energy source around here. The alliance are fervently searching for more advanced power sources. Some say that is why they have spread out their prying eyes all over this solar system.
Rumor2 = Have you done any good yet? I hope you are here to actually help us out. Many are only here for the money. Oh-so-sad for them when they realise that Sector X is a quite bad place to treasure hunt. The Alliance and the rebels came here first.
Rumor3 = Why is this part of the solar system called Sector X? It once had a name, which is long forgotten. I think the name Sector X is a recognition to that oblivion will reach everything. Everything will be forgotten.

[RO_Rebel_Station_1]
Rumor1 = As you see, life is not that good here. People are desperate. And the Alliance is sucking out our last resources, gathering them at Fortrun. I hope all their shields fail to recharge.
Rumor2 = It is getting harder and harder to keep up with the Alliance's technology. First their shields, and now that stealth! I have heard about a weapon though able to suck the energy out of their shields. I wonder if it exists...
Rumor3 = You think we should stop raiding the Alliance's transports? You know, we don't do it because we want to. We desperately need that food they are stealing from our people.

[SX_Peye]
Rumor1 = Both the Alliance and the rebels are attempting to get their hands on the science performed here. The scientists seem very hestitant about both rebels and the Alliance though...
Rumor2 = Have you heard the story of old Earth. The place we used to live. Heard they blew it all to pieces and now we are all stuck here.
Rumor3 = We've got to hold together in this sector. It might be hard times now, but my gut tells me this is only the beginning. After rain comes thunder.
Rumor4 = Do you have an interesting idea of a new weapon? Please send an email to Jakob with proposed specifications. Use the highly secret header "PANCAKE". The best proposal will be put in the game, and (in some way) named after you.
Rumor5 = Have you beaten the mad scientists level yet? I have heard it is the hardest challenge currently seen in Sector X. Good luck with that!
Rumor6 = Did you know the scientists here invented the Beacons? Amazing! They also invented Bacon.
Rumor7 = Lately, a lot of research seems to have been performed on the rare mineral Murt. I wonder what's up with that...

[OX_OutpostX_Station]
Rumor1 = This is a lonely place. We are a handful of people trying to make our living here. Sometimes I wonder why we even try.
Rumor2 = What brings you to this empty place? You are welcome, as long as you don't talk too much. Talkers are the worst.
Rumor3 = Some people seem to use this place as a get-away from the society. Preferring the stillness over the constant buzzing on the other plants.
Rumor4 = You should't stay for too long in this place..... After a while, you start to feel your sanity slip away....... Slowly....... Slipping......
Rumor5 = There is something strange about this place. I swear I can feel something in the air. A tingling sensation.

[SY_GreyPlanet]
Rumor1 = I heard that the people on the Iceplanet recently were attacked by pirates.
Rumor2 = Have you heard the story of old Earth. The place we used to live. Heard they blew it all to pieces and now we are all stuck here.
Rumor3 = Jakobs favorite hobby is making countless strings!

[SY_GreenPlanet]
Rumor1 = Have you heard about Jakob? He eats raw potatoes!
Rumor2 = I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Jakob likes Ellen!
Rumor3 = I heard that the people on the Iceplanet recently were attacked by pirates.
